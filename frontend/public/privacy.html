            <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
                information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child

                those of your jurisdiction. If you are located outside Ukraine and choose to provide information to us,
                please note that we transfer the information to Ukraine and process it there.</p>

            <p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using your personal
                information depends on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect
                it. We will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so,
                where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our
                legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and
                freedoms.</p>
